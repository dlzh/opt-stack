Database Management
===================

The default metadata driver for glance uses sqlalchemy, which implies there
exists a backend database which must be managed. The ``glance-manage`` binary
provides a set of commands for making this easier.


Initializing an Empty Database
------------------------------

    glance-manage db_sync

This will take an empty database and create the necessary tables.


Determining the Database Version
--------------------------------

    glance-manage db_version

This will print the version of a glance database.


Upgrading an Existing Database
------------------------------

    glance-manage db_sync <VERSION>

This will take an existing database and upgrade it to the specified VERSION.


Downgrading an Existing Database
--------------------------------

    glance-manage downgrade <VERSION>

This will downgrade an existing database from the current version to the
specified VERSION.
